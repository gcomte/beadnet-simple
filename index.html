<h1 id="beadnet-alpha-preview-">BeadNet demo for Puzzle ITC</h1>
<p>
    A visualisation of how Lightning Network salary payments could work at Puzzle ITC and how our employees
    could spend all their money at Digitec ;-)<br/>
    This demo is based on the <a href="https://github.com/mojoaxel/beadnet">BeadNet library</a> of
    <a href="//github.com/mojoaxel">Alexander Wunschik</a>.
</p>
<!--
<br/><br/><br/>
<h4>Todo:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Optimize channel draw length, node placement. Maybe give some nodes a flag that they're routing nodes.</li>
    <li>Node info on click</li>
    <li>Moving beads different color</li>
</ul>
-->
